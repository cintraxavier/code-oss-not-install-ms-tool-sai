# code-oss-not-install-ms-tool-sai
Not install or actual the program 

This the message:

It is not possible to install the extension "ms-toolsai.-jupyter' because it is not compatible with the current version VS Code (version 1.58.0), and it has already been installed and re-installed and nothing happens. 
When I try to program with Python, I can't install to my version 1.58.0 for ms-tool-sai or what appears to me. If you can help me.
